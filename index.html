            <p>The unicorn is a legendary creature that has been described since antiquity
                 as a beast with a single large, pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its
                  forehead. The unicorn was depicted in ancient seals of the Indus Valley 
                  Civilization and was mentioned by the ancient Greeks in accounts of natural 
                  history by various writers, including Ctesias, Strabo, Pliny the Younger, 
                  Aelian and Cosmas Indicopleustes. The Bible also describes an animal, 
                  the re'em, which some versions translate as unicorn.

            <p>In European folklore, the unicorn is often depicted as a white horse-like or goat-like animal with a long horn, 
                cloven hooves, and sometimes a goat's beard. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it was commonly described as 
                an extremely wild woodland creature, a symbol of purity and grace, which could be captured only by a virgin. 
                In the encyclopedias, its horn was said to have the power to render poisoned water potable and to heal sickness. 
                In medieval and Renaissance times, the tusk of the narwhal was sometimes sold as unicorn horn.
                The unicorn continues to hold a place in popular culture. It is often used as a symbol of fantasy or rarity.</p>
